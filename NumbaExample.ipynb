Let's see if this is faster. To do so, I will write two lines of code; the first makes a 10,000 element array filled with $\\pi/2$, and the second line directs numpy to take the $sin$ of each element. This code is assigned to a string variable with triple quotes, which the timeit() function will strip off before evaluation. "
